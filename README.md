HAWKS
======
**HAWKS** is an Android app that controls the movement of a quadcopter. 

Description
-----
HAWKS is a smartphone application that allows a user to control the movement of a drone by moving the device itself. The finished application, developed for Android, uses data from the device gyroscope and accelerometer to detect tilt or acceleration. The device calculates the direction in which the drone should move and sends the command over a Bluetooth connection to a laptop. The laptop then sends commands directly to the drone over 802.11. Instead of using the gyroscope and accelerometer, commands for takeoff, landing, and up/down movement are initiated by buttons on the app UI and are sent to the drone in the same way.
